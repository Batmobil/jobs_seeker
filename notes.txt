Notes on jobs dashboard:
add cities Dropdown
check data and dates on Graph (for now graph is cumulative, we need to change this)
add graph with % of total jobs for ds and da positions, add total jobs baseline.
Add column chart by companies (stack by sponsored or not?)
deploy to heroku with automatic scrape script run.
improve dashboard viz.
