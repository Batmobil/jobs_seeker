Notes on jobs dashboard:
Dockerize app
add cities Dropdown
check data and dates on Graph (for now graph is cumulative, we need to change this)
add graph with % of total jobs for ds and da positions, add total jobs baseline.
Add column chart by companies (stack by sponsored or not?)
add tabs.
add graph with month to month variations
add pie chart with ratio of positions.
add graph with ration over city population
Before to deploy, create 2 branches on git, one for dev, one for prod.
deploy to heroku with automatic scrape script run.
